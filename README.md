# `ProjectSP` | Possibilities are endless!!!

Tech Used:

AngularJS, Auth0, jquery, Animate.css, Sweetalert, Font Awesome and Bootstrap to name a few. Will likely
 be adding more as time goes on. Server back-end is ASP.NET MVC 5, Entity Framework 6 and WebAPI 2. API is pretty close to the 
 one I have on GitHub.  Site can be seen at www.spire-web.com
